# Simon-Game-Web-Application
The Simon Game web application is a digital adaptation of the classic memory game "Simon." Players must replicate the sequence by clicking on the blocks in the correct order. As the game progresses, the sequences become longer and more challenging, testing the player's memory skills.

Gameplay Mechanics: The game begins with a single block flashing to indicate the first step of the sequence. The player must click on the block that flashed. After the player clicks the correct block, the game adds another block to the sequence, which the player must then replicate. This process continues, with the sequence growing longer each round.
Each time a block flashes or when the player successfully completes a sequence, corresponding sound effects provide feedback to the player, enhancing the interactive experience.

Technologies Used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (includes jQuery), Audio API
